# FinTech-Module-7-ETF-Analyzer

# Create a Web Application for an ETF Analyzer

In this exercise you will build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.9.7 ((default, Sep 16 2021, 16:59:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32) with the following packages:
 
* [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/urls.html#managing-workspaces-ui) - For information about the jupyter lab remote workspace hosted by a local computer.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) - Source repository. 
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
 
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Source repository. 
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) pandas documentation.
The PyData ecosystem has a number of core Python data containers that allow users to work with a wide array of datatypes

* [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/) - SQLAlchemy 1.4 documentation.
The SQLAlchemy SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper is a comprehensive set of tools for working with databases and Python.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
import sqlalchemy
```

Create a temporary SQLite database and populate the database with content from the etf.db seed file
```
database_connection_string = 'sqlite:///etf.db'
```

Create an engine to interact with the SQLite database
```
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(database_connection_string)
```

## Usage

The detailed instructions are divided into the following parts:

    Analyze a single asset in the ETF

    Optimize data access with Advanced SQL queries

    Analyze the ETF portfolio

    Deploy the notebook as a web application
